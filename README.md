# AMERICA-Space-Vehicle-Design
Repository containing code, spreadsheets, and CAD files pertaining to the AMERICA mission proposal for Space Vehicle Design 

## Overview
Contained within this repository is code, spreadsheets, and CAD files generated by members of the AMERICA capstone group. The project took place at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Fall of 2019. The project was to propose a mock NASA Discovery mission based on a modified version of the NASA AO for such missions. 

The repository is split into subfolders for each system of the spacecraft. These include the following:
- Astrodynamics
- Entry, Descent, and Landing
- Thermal Protection System
- Propulsion
- Thermal Control System
- Mechanical
- Communications
- Command and Data Handling
- Power
- Cost

**Note:** This list of subsystems is not a comprehensive list of every subsystem. These are merely the subsystems that required computer aid for their design/development.
